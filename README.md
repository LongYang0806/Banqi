## Instruction

### How to play

For the version later than 1.2.0, you need either the emulator or the container to start play.

#### Use the emulator
- [GWT-Emulator] (http://smg-gwt-emulator.appspot.com/GwtEmulator.html)
- [AngularJS-Emulator] (http://4.smg-angularjs-emulator.appspot.com/)

Warning: The animation can not be properly performed in the latest version (V4 & V3) of GWT-Emulator.

#### Use the container
- [GWT-Container] (http://5-dot-smg-gwt-container.appspot.com/demo.html)
- [AngularJS-Container] (http://smg-angularjs-container.appspot.com/#/) (My SMG team project, check [here] (https://github.com/chongzizil/SMG-AngularJS-Container) :) )
